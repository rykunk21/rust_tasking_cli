**Task Manager Command-Line Application**

**Description:**
Build a command-line task manager application that allows users to manage their tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, list tasks, and delete tasks. You can also include features like categorizing tasks, setting due dates, and prioritizing tasks.

**Key Features:**

**Task CRUD Operations:**
- Add a new task with a title and description.
- Mark a task as completed.
- List all tasks.
- Delete a task.

**Task Properties:**
- Allow tasks to have additional properties like due date, priority, and categories.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
- Implement a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the task manager.
- Use a Rust CLI library (e.g., clap or structopt) to handle command parsing and user input.

**File Storage:**
- Persist tasks to a file, allowing users to save and load their task list across sessions.
- Explore Rust file I/O and serialization/deserialization (e.g., using serde).

**Error Handling:**
- Implement robust error handling for file operations, user input, and task management.

**Unit Testing:**
- Write unit tests for critical components of your application, ensuring correctness and reliability.

**Concurrency:**
- Explore concurrency in Rust by implementing asynchronous task operations (e.g., fetching tasks concurrently).

**Documentation:**
- Provide comprehensive documentation for your project, including usage instructions, API documentation, and explanations of design decisions.

**Learning Goals:**
- Explore Rust's ownership system, borrowing, and lifetimes in the context of managing task data.
- Gain hands-on experience with Rust's error handling and Result type.
- Practice implementing a command-line interface using a Rust CLI library.
- Learn about file I/O and serialization/deserialization in Rust.
- Apply unit testing to ensure code correctness.
- Explore concurrency in Rust by implementing asynchronous operations.
- Enhance documentation skills by providing clear and comprehensive project documentation.

This project allows you to build a practical tool that you can use daily for managing tasks while challenging you to apply various Rust concepts and features. Feel free to customize the project based on your interests and extend its features to align with your specific needs.
